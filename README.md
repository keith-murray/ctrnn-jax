# CT-RNN Implementation in Python's JAX ecosystem
This repository is an implementation of continuous-time recurrent neural networks (CT-RNNs) in the Python programming language and [JAX ecosystem](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Specifically, the architecture and training of CT-RNNs are implemented with the [Flax Linen](https://flax-linen.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [Optax APIs](https://optax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), respectively.
